**University of Edinburgh**

**School of Mathematics**

**Bayesian Data Analysis, 2021/2022, Semester 2**

**Lecturer: Daniel Paulin**

**Assignment 1**

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT**

**In this paragraph, we summarize the essential information about this
assignment. The format and rules for this assignment are different from
your other courses, so please pay attention.**

**1) Deadline: The deadline for submitting your solutions to this
assignment is the 7 March 12:00 noon Edinburgh time.**

**2) Format: You will need to submit your work as 2 components: a PDF
report, and your R Markdown (.Rmd) notebook. There will be two separate
submission systems on Learn: Gradescope for the report in PDF format,
and a Learn assignment for the code in Rmd format. You are encouraged to
write your solutions into this R Markdown notebook (code in R chunks and
explanations in Markdown chunks), and then select Knit/Knit to PDF in
RStudio to create a PDF report.**

![](knit_to_PDF.jpg){width="191"}

**It suffices to upload this PDF in Gradescope submission system, and
your Rmd file in the Learn assignment submission system. You will be
required to tag every sub question on Gradescope. A video describing the
submission process will be posted on Learn.**

**Some key points that are different from other courses:**

**a) Your report needs to contain written explanation for each question
that you solve, and some numbers or plots showing your results.
Solutions without written explanation that clearly demonstrates that you
understand what you are doing will be marked as 0 irrespectively whether
the numerics are correct or not.**

**b) Your code has to be possible to run for all questions by the Run
All in RStudio, and reproduce all of the numerics and plots in your
report (up to some small randomness due to stochasticity of Monte Carlo
simulations). The parts of the report that contain material that is not
reproduced by the code will not be marked (i.e. the score will be 0),
and the only feedback in this case will be that the results are not
reproducible from the code.**

![](run_all.jpg){width="376"}

**c) Multiple Submissions are allowed BEFORE THE DEADLINE are allowed
for both the report, and the code. However, multiple submissions are NOT
ALLOWED AFTER THE DEADLINE. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO
YOUR SUBMISSION AFTER THE DEADLINE. Nevertheless, if you did not submit
anything before the deadline, then you can still submit your work after
the deadline. Late penalties will apply unless you have a valid
extension. The timing of the late penalties will be determined by the
time you have submitted BOTH the report, and the code (i.e. whichever
was submitted later counts).**

**We illustrate these rules by some examples:**

**Alice has spent a lot of time and effort on her assignment for BDA.
Unfortunately she has accidentally introduced a typo in her code in the
first question, and it did not run using Run All in RStudio. - Alice
will get 0 for the whole assignment, with the only feedback "Results are
not reproducible from the code".**

**Bob has spent a lot of time and effort on his assignment for BDA.
Unfortunately he forgot to submit his code. - Bob will get no personal
reminder to submit his code. Bob will get 0 for the whole assignment,
with the only feedback "Results are not reproducible from the code, as
the code was not submitted."**

**Charles has spent a lot of time and effort on his assignment for BDA.
He has submitted both his code and report in the correct formats.
However, he did not include any explanations in the report. Charles will
get 0 for the whole assignment, with the only feedback "Explanation is
missing."**

**Denise has spent a lot of time and effort on her assignment for BDA.
She has submitted her report in the correct format, but thought that she
can include her code as a link in the report, and upload it online (such
as Github, or Dropbox). - Denise will get 0 for the whole assignment,
with the only feedback "Code was not uploaded on Learn."**

**3) Group work: This is an INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT, like a 2 week exam
for the course. Communication between students about the assignment
questions is not permitted. Students who submit work that has not been
done individually will be reported for Academic Misconduct, that can
lead to serious consequences. Each problem will be marked by a single
instructor, so we will be able to spot students who copy.**

**4) Piazza: You are NOT ALLOWED to post questions about Assignment
Problems visible to Everyone on Piazza. You need to specify the
visibility of such questions as Instructors only, by selecting Post to /
Individual students/Instructors and type in Instructors and click on the
blue Instructors banner that appears below**

![](piazza_instructors.jpg)

**Students who post any information related to the solution of
assignment problems visible to their classmates will**

**a) have their access to Piazza revoked for the rest of the course
without prior warning, and**

**b) reported for Academic Misconduct.**

**Only questions regarding clarification of the statement of the
problems will be answered by the instructors. The instructors will not
give you any information related to the solution of the problems, such
questions will be simply answered as "This is not about the statement of
the problem so we cannot answer your question."**

**THE INSTRUCTORS ARE NOT GOING TO DEBUG YOUR CODE, AND YOU ARE ASSESSED
ON YOUR ABILITY TO RESOLVE ANY CODING OR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU
ENCOUNTER ON YOUR OWN.**

**5) Office hours: There will be two office hours per week (Monday
16:00-17:00, and Wednesdays 16:00-17:00) during the 2 weeks for this
assignment. The links are available on Learn / Course Information. We
will be happy to discuss the course/workshop materials. However, we will
only answer questions about the assignment that require clarifying the
statement of the problems, and will not give you any information about
the solutions. Students who ask for feedback on their assignment
solutions during office hours will be removed from the meeting.**

**6) Late submissions and extensions: Students who have existing
Learning Adjustments in Euclid will be allowed to have the same
adjustments applied to this course as well, but they need to apply for
this BEFORE THE DEADLINE on the website**

<https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances>

**by clicking on "Access your learning adjustment". This will be
approved automatically.**

**For students without Learning Adjustments, if there is a justifiable
reason (external circumstances) for not being able to submit your
assignment in time, then you can apply for an extension BEFORE THE
DEADLINE on the website**

<https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances>

**by clicking on "Apply for an extension". Such extensions are processed
entirely by the central ESC team. The course instructors have no role in
this decision so you should not write to us about such applications. You
can contact our Student Learning Advisor, Maria Tovar Gallardo
([maria.tovar\@ed.ac.uk](mailto:maria.tovar@ed.ac.uk){.email}) in case
you need some advice regarding this.**

**Students who submit their work late will have late submission
penalties applied by the ESC team automatically (this means that even if
you are 1 second late because of your internet connection was slow, the
penalties will still apply). The penalties are 5% of the total mark
deduced for every day of delay started (i.e. one minute of delay counts
for 1 day). The course intructors do not have any role in setting these
penalties, we will not be able to change them.**

The first picture is a rotifier (by Steve Gschmeissner), the second is a
unicellular algae (by NEON ja, colored by Richard Bartz).

**Problem 1 - Rotifier and algae data**

**In this problem, we study an experimental dataset (Blasius et al.
2020, <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1857-0>) about predator-prey
relationship between two microscopic organism: rotifier (predator) and
unicellular green algae (prey). These were studied in a controlled
environment (water tank) in a laboratory over 375 days. The dataset
contains daily observations of the concentration of algae and rotifiers.
The units of measurement in the algae column is** $\mathbf{10^6}$
**algae cells per ml of water, while in the rotifier column it is the
number of rotifiers per ml of water.**

**We are going to apply a simple two dimensional state space model on
this data using JAGS. The first step is to load JAGS and the dataset.**

```{r}
# We load JAGS
library(rjags)

#You may need to set the working directory first before loading the dataset
#setwd("/Users/dpaulin/Dropbox/BDA_2021_22/Assignments/Assignment1")
rotifier_algae=read.csv("rotifier_algae.csv")
#The first 6 rows of the dataframe
print.data.frame(rotifier_algae[1:6,])
```

**As we can see, some values in the dataset are missing (NA)**.

**We are going to model the true log concentrations** $\mathbf{x}_t$
**by the state space
model**$$\mathbf{x}_t = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}_{t-1}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{w}_t; \quad \mathbf{w}_t\sim N\left(0,\left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_R^2 & 0\\ 0 & \sigma_A^2\end{matrix}\right)\right)$$\
**where** $\mathbf{A}$**,** $\mathbf{b}$, $\sigma^2_R$ **and**
$\sigma^2_A$ **are model parameters, and** $t$ **denotes the time point.
In particular,** $t=0$ **corresponds to day 0, and** $t=1,2,\ldots, 375$
**correspond to days 1-375.**

**Here** $\mathbf{x}_t$ **is a two dimensional vector. The first
component denotes the logarithm of the rotifier concentration measured
in number of rotifiers per ml of water, and the second component denotes
the logarithm of the algae concentration measured in** $10^6$ **algae
per ml (these units are the same as in the dataset).**
$\mathbf{A}=\left(\begin{matrix}A_{11} & A_{12}\\ A_{21} & A_{22}\end{matrix}\right)$
**is a two times two matrix, and** $\mathbf{b}$ **is a two dimensional
vector.**

**The observation process is described as**
$$\mathbf{y}_t =\mathbf{x}_{t}+\mathbf{v}_t, \quad \mathbf{v}_t\sim N\left(0,\left(\begin{matrix}\eta_R^2 & 0\\ 0 & \eta_A^2\end{matrix}\right)\right),$$

**where** $\mathbf{y}_t$ **is the observed log concentration on day**
$t$ **(for example,**
$\mathbf{y}_2=\left(\begin{matrix}\log(6.58)\\ \log(0.82)\end{matrix}\right)$
**in our dataset), while** $\eta_R^2$ **and** $\eta_R^2$ **are
additional model parameters.**

**a)[10 marks] Create a JAGS model that fits the above state space model
on the rotifier-algae dataset for the whole 375 days period.**

**Use 10000 burn-in steps and obtain 50000 samples from the model
parameters**
$\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{b}, \sigma_R^2, \sigma_A^2, \eta_R^2, \eta_A^2$
**(4+2+4=10 parameters in total).**

**Use a Gaussian prior**
$N\left(\left(\begin{matrix}\log(6)\\ \log(1.5) \end{matrix}\right), \left(\begin{matrix}4 & 0\\ 0 & 4\end{matrix}\right) \right)$
**for the initial state** $\mathbf{x}_0$**, Gaussian prior**
$N\left(\left(\begin{matrix}0\\ 0 \end{matrix}\right), \left(\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{matrix}\right) \right)$
**for** $\mathbf{b}$**, and inverse Gamma (0.1,0.1) prior for the
variance parameters** $\sigma_R^2, \sigma_A^2, \eta_R^2, \eta_A^2$**.**

**Explain how did you handle the fact that some of the observations are
missing (NA) in the dataset.**

Explanation: (Write your explanation here)

```{r}

```

**b)[10 marks]**

**Based on your MCMC samples, compute the Gelman-Rubin convergence
diagnostics (Hint: you need to run multiple chains in parallel for this
by setting the n.chains parameter). Discuss how well has the chain
converged to the stationary distribution based on the results.**

**Print out the summary of the fitted JAGS model. Do autocorrelation
plots for the 4 components of the model parameter** $\mathbf{A}$**.**

**Compute and print out the effective sample sizes (ESS) for each of the
model parameters**
$\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{b}, \sigma_R^2, \sigma_A^2, \eta_R^2, \eta_A^2$**.**

**If the ESS is below 1000 for any of these 10 parameters, increase the
sample size/number of chains until the ESS is above 1000 for all 10
parameters.**

```{r}

```

**c)[10 marks]**

**We are going to perform posterior predictive checks to evaluate the
fit of this model on the data (using the priors stated in question a).
First, create replicate observations from the posterior predictive using
JAGS. The number of replicate observations should be at least 1000.**

**Compute the minimum, maximum, and median for both log-concentrations
(i.e. both for rotifier and algae,** $3\cdot 2=6$ **in total).**

**Plot the histograms for these quantities together with a line that
shows the value of the function considered on the actual dataset (see
the R code for Lecture 2 for an example). Compute the DIC score for the
model (Hint: you can use the `dic.samples` function for this).**

**Discuss the results.**

Explanation: (Write your explanation here)

```{r}

```

**d)[10 marks]**

**Discuss the meaning of the** **model parameters**
$\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{b}, \sigma_R^2, \sigma_A^2, \eta_R^2, \eta_A^2$**.
Find a website or paper that that contains information about rotifiers
and unicellular algae (Hint: you can use Google search for this). Using
your understanding of the meaning of model parameters and the biological
information about these organisms, construct more informative prior
distributions for the model parameters. State in your report the source
of information and the rationale for your choices of priors.**

**Re-implement the JAGS model with these new priors. Perform the same
posterior predictive checks as in part c) to evaluate the fit of this
new model on the data.**

**Compute the DIC score for the model as well (Hint: lower DIC score
indicates better fit on the data).**

**Discuss whether your new priors have improved the model fit compared
to the original prior from a).**

Explanation: (Write your explanation here)

```{r}

```

**e)[10 marks] Update the model with your informative prior in part d)
to compute the posterior distribution of the log concentrations sizes
(**$\mathbf{x}_t$**) on the days 376-395 (20 additional days).**

**Plot the evolution of the posterior mean of the log concentrations for
rotifier and algae during days 376-395 on a single plot, along with
curves that correspond to the [2.5%, 97.5%] credible interval of the log
concentration size (**$\mathbf{x}_t$\*\*) according to the posterior
distribution at each year [Hint: you need\*\*\*\* $2+2\cdot 2 = 6$
\*\*curves in total, use different colours for the curves for rotifier
and algae].

**Finally, estimate the posterior probability that the concentration of
algae (measured in 10\^6 algae/ml, as in the data) becomes smaller
than** $0.1$ **at any time during this 20 additional days (days
376-395).**

![](horse_racing.jpg){width="100%"}

**Problem 2 - Horse racing data**

**In this problem, we are going to construct a predictive model for
horse races. The dataset (races.csv and runs.csv) contains the
information about 1000 horse races in Hong Kong during the years
1997-1998 (originally from <https://www.kaggle.com/gdaley/hkracing>).
Races.csv contains information about each race (such as distance, venue,
track conditions, etc.), while runs.csv contains information about each
horse participating in each race (such as finish time in the race).
Detailed description of all columns in these files is available in the
file horse_racing_data_info.txt.**

**Our goal is to model the mean speed of each horse during the races
based on covariates available before the race begins.**

**We are going to use INLA to fit several different regression models to
this dataset. First, we load ILNA and the datasets and display the first
few rows.**

```{r}
library(INLA)

#If it loaded correctly, you should see this in the output:
#Loading required package: Matrix
#Loading required package: foreach
#Loading required package: parallel
#Loading required package: sp
#This is INLA_21.11.22 built 2021-11-21 16:13:28 UTC.
# - See www.r-inla.org/contact-us for how to get help.
# - To enable PARDISO sparse library; see inla.pardiso()

#The following code does the full installation. You can try it if INLA has not been installed.
#First installing some of the dependencies
#install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install("Rgraphviz")
#if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))

```

```{r}
runs <- read.csv(file = 'runs.csv')
head(runs)
```

```{r}
races<- read.csv(file = 'races.csv')
head(races)
```

**a)[10 marks] Create a dataframe that includes the mean speed of each
horse in each race and the distance of the race in a column [Hint: you
can do this adding two extra columns to the runs dataframe].**

**Fit a linear regression model (lm) with the mean speed as a response
variable. The covariates should be the horse id as a categorical
variable, and the race distance, horse rating, and horse age as standard
variable. Scale the non-categorical covariates before fitting the model
(i.e. center and divide by their standard deviation, you can use the**
`scale` **function in R for this).**

**Print out the summary of the lm model, discuss the quality of the
fit.**

Explanation: (Write your explanation here)

```{r}

```

**b)[10 marks] Fit the same model in INLA (i.e. Bayesian linear
regression with Gaussian likelihood, mean speed is the response
variable, and the same covariates used with scaling for the
non-categorical covariates). Set a Gamma (0.1,0.1) prior for the
precision, and Gaussian priors with mean zero and variance 1000000 for
all of the regression coefficients (including the intercept).**

**Print out the summary of the INLA model. Compute the posterior mean of
the variance parameter** $\sigma^2$**. Plot the posterior density for
the variance parameter** $\sigma^2$**. Compute the negative sum log CPO
(NSLCPO) and DIC values for this model (smaller values indicate better
fit).**

**Compute the standard deviation of the mean residuals (i.e. the
differences between the posterior mean of the fitted values and the true
response variable).**

**Discuss the results.**

Explanation: (Write your explanation here)

```{r}

```

**c)[10 marks] In this question, we are going to improve the model in b)
by using more informative priors and more columns from the dataset.**

**First, using some publicly available information from the internet
(Hint: use Google search) find out about the typical speed of race
horses in Hong Kong, and use this information to construct a prior for
the intercept. Explain the rationale for your choice.**

**Second, look through all of the information in the datasets that is
available before the race (Hint: you need to read the description
horse_racing_data_info.txt for information about the columns. position,
behind, result, won, and time related columns are not available before
the race). Discuss your rationale for including some of these in the
dataset (make sure to scale them if they are non-categorical).**

**Feel free to try creating additional covariates such as polynomial or
interaction terms (Hint: this can be done using I() in the formula), and
you can also try to use a different likelihood (such as Student-t
distribution).**

**Fit your new model in INLA (i.e. Bayesian linear regression, mean
speed is the response variable, and scaling done for the non-categorical
covariates).**

**Print out the summary of the INLA model. Compute the negative sum log
CPO (NSLCPO) and DIC values for this model (smaller values indicate
better fit).**

**Compute the standard deviation of the mean residuals (i.e. the
differences between the posterior mean of the fitted values and the true
response variable).**

**Discuss the results and compare your model to the model from b).**

**Please only include your best performing model in the report.**

Explanation: (Write your explanation here)

```{r}

```

**d)[10 marks] We are going to perform model checks to evaluate the fit
the two models in parts b) and c) on the data.**

**Compute the studentized residuals for the Bayesian regression model
from parts b) and c). Perform a simple Q-Q plot on the studentized
residuals. Plot the studentized residuals versus their index, and also
plot the studentized residuals against the posterior mean of the fitted
value (see Lecture 2). Discuss the results.**

Explanation: (Write your explanation here)

```{r}

```

**e)[10 marks] In this question, we are going to use the model you have
constructed in part c) to predict a new race, i.e. calculate the
posterior probabilities of each participating horse winning that race.
First, we load the dataset containing information about the future
race.**

```{r}
race_to_predict <- read.csv(file = 'race_to_predict.csv')
race_to_predict
```

```{r}
runs_to_predict <- read.csv(file = 'runs_to_predict.csv')
runs_to_predict
```

**Based on your model from part c), compute the posterior probabilities
of each of these 14 horses winning the race. [Hint: you will need to
sample from the posterior predictive distribution.]**

```{r}

```
